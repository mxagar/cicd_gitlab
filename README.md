# CI/CI Pipelines with Gitlab and Github

This folder contains the notes made by me after following two Udemy courses:

- the first by Valentin Despa, focused on Gitlab: [GitLab CI: Pipelines, CI/CD and DevOps for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/gitlab-ci-pipelines-ci-cd-and-devops-for-beginners/).
- the second by Ali Alaa, which deals with Github: [The Complete GitHub Actions & Workflows Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/github-actions/)

## Gitlab Pipelines

A PDF of the course note created by the instructor (Valentin Despa) can be downloaded from
[gitlab-ci-course-notes.pdf](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/gitlab-ci-course-notes/latest/gitlab-ci-course-notes.pdf).

My notes are in `gitlab_ci_cd_howto.md`.

## Github Actions

TBD.

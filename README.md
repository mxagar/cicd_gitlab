# CI/CI Pipelines with Gitlab

This folder contains the notes made by me after following the
Udemy course by Valentin Despa
*GitLab CI: Pipelines, CI/CD and DevOps for Beginners*.

A PDF of the course note created by the instructor can be downloaded from
[gitlab-ci-course-notes.pdf](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/gitlab-ci-course-notes/latest/gitlab-ci-course-notes.pdf).

The notes are in `gitlab_ci_cd_howto.md`.
